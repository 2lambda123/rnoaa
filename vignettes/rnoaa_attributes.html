<h4 id="first-flag-measurement-flag">First flag (Measurement Flag)</h4>
<p>A - Accumulated amount. This value is a total that may include data from a previous month or months (TPCP).</p>
<p>B - Adjusted Total. Monthly value totals based on proportional available data across the entire month. (CLDD, HTDD)</p>
<p>E - An estimated monthly or annual total.</p>
<p>I - Monthly means or totals based on incomplete time series. 1 to 9 days are missing. (MMNT,MMXP, MMXT, MNTM, TPCP, TSNW)</p>
<p>M - used to indicate data element missing.</p>
<p>S - Precipitation for the amount is continuing to be accumulated. Total will be included in a subsequent value (TPCP).</p>
<p>Example: Days 1-20 had 1.35 inches of precipitation, then a period of accumulation began. The element TPCP would then be 00135S and the total accumulated amount value appears in a subsequent monthly value.</p>
<p>If TPCP = 0 there was no precipitation measured during the month. Flag 1 is set to &quot;S&quot; and the total accumulated amount appears in a subsequent monthly value.</p>
<p>T - Trace of precipitation, snowfall, or snow depth. The precipitation data value will = &quot;00000&quot;. (EMXP, MXSD, TPCP, TSNW)</p>

<h4 id="completeness-flag-attribute">Completeness Flag (Attribute)</h4>
<p>Flags accompany every Normals value and indicate the completeness of the data record used to compute each value, accounting for methodological differences for different product classes. There are six flag options described generally in Table 1 below. Due to methodological differences, the flags are applied somewhat differently between the temperature-based normals and the precipitation-based normals. For the precipitation-based and hourly normals, the following flags were assigned independently for each normals value reported based on number of years available for that individual calculation. For temperature-based normals, strong precedence is given to the monthly normals of maximum and minimum temperature or derived from the flags for these two variables.</p>
<p>C = complete (all 30 years used) S = standard (no more than 5 years missing and no more than 3 consecutive years missing among the sufficiently complete years) R = representative (observed record utilized incomplete, but value was scaled or based on filled values to be representative of the full period of record) P = provisional (at least 10 years used, but not sufficiently complete to be labeled as standard or representative). Also used for parameter values on February 29 as well as for interpolated daily precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth percentiles. Q = quasi-normal (at least 2 years per month, but not sufficiently complete to be labeled as provisional or any other higher flag code. The associated value was computed using a pseudonormals approach or derived from monthly pseudonormals. Blank = the data value is reported as a special value, such as 9999 (special values given in section B of III. Additional Information below)</p>
<p>Note: Flags Q and R also aren't applicable to daily precipitation/snowfall/snow depth percentiles. Further, Q flags are not applicable for standard deviations.</p>

<h4 id="data-measurement-flag-attribute">Data Measurement Flag (Attribute)</h4>
<p>Note: This field is left blank when no flag is needed.</p>
<p>a: Begin accumulation. A data value of 99999 accompanies this flag. It indicates that the accumulation has begun at some time during the hour.</p>
<p>A: End accumulation (an amount is associated with this flag). It indicates that accumulation has ended sometime during the hour. Accumulated period indicates that the precipitation amount is correct, but only the exact beginning and ending times are known. A data value of 99999 occurring on the last day and hour of a month indicates the accumulation continues into the next month.</p>
<p>, (comma): Used at the beginning of a data month when an accumulation is in progress from the previous month. A data value of 99999 always accompanies this flag. This flag is used prior to 1984.</p>
<p>{ : Begin deleted period during the hour (inclusive). The original data were received, but were unreadable or clearly recognized as noise. A value of 99999 accompanies this flag. Primarily used since 1984. Also used in Alaska for 1976-1978.</p>
<p>}: End deleted period during the hour (inclusive). The original data were received, but were unreadable or clearly recognized as noise. A value of 99999 accompanies this flag. Primarily used since 1984. Also used in Alaska for 1976-1978.</p>
<p>[: Begin missing period during the hour (inclusive). A value of 99999 accompanies this flag.</p>
<p>]: End missing period during the hour (inclusive). A value of 99999 accompanies this flag. Prior to 1984 if precipitation occurred during the last hour of the missing period, the ending missing value appears with a non-zero value. Beginning in 1984, the beginning and ending hours of the missing period are recorded as &quot;99999[&quot; and &quot;99999],&quot; respectively.. A missing flag indicates that the data were not received. The flag appears on the first and last day of each month for which data were not received or not processed by NCDC.</p>
<p>E: Evaporation may have occurred. Data may or may not be reliable. This flag was used during the period 1984-1993.</p>
<p>g: Only used for day 1, hour 0100, when precipitation amount is zero.</p>
<p>T: Indicates a &quot;trace&quot; amount. Data value with this will be zero. &quot;T&quot; flags appear on National Weather Service data only since July 1996.</p>
<p>M: Missing data. No data available for this period.</p>
<h4 id="data-quality-flag-attribute">Data Quality Flag (Attribute)</h4>
<p>Z: Indicates probable amounts as a result of melting frozen precipitation. This flag may be used to identify those sites that are deficient in the manner the snow shields are employed. Used since January 1996.</p>
<p>R: This data value failed one of the NCDC's quality control tests.</p>
<p>Q: Pre 1996 usage - Indicates value failed an extreme value test (value will be present). Data are to be used with caution.</p>
<p>Extreme tests used are 1) value was not an accumulated amount and was higher than the one-hour statewide 100 year return period precipitation amount or 2) if they value was an accumulated amount and was higher than the 24 hour statewide extreme precipitation total.</p>
<p>Q: 1996 to present usage - A single erroneous value (value will be present). Rarely used since 1996.</p>
<p>q: An hourly value excludes one or more 15 minute periods. Lowest data resolution is 15 minutes. Used since January 1996.</p>
