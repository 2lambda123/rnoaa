Title: NOAA Climate Data from R.
Description: This is an R wrapper to many NOAA data sources including the NCDC
    climate API at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2, with
    functions for each of the API endpoints: data, data categories, data sets,
    data types, locations, location categories, and stations. In addition, we
    have an interface for NOAA sea ice data, the NOAA severe weather inventory,
    ERDDAP data, NOAA Historical Observing Metadata Repository (HOMR) data,
    NOAA storm data via IBTrACS, and tornado data via the NOAA storm prediction
    center. NOAA buoy data is only on the buoy branch in the Github repository
    for this package (see url below).
