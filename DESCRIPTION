Title: NOAA climate data from R.
Description: This is an R wrapper to the NOAA climate data API at
    http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2. There are functions for
    each of the API endpoints: data, data categories, data sets, data types,
    locations, location categories, and stations. In addition, we have an
    interface for NOAA sea ice data that is not part of the climate data API.
