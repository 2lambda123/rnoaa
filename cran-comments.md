R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install on R 3.1.2 and R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win builder.

A note about many submissions from me. Brian Ripley requests that decrease my submissions. The past few have been in response to requests to update packages, so I hope it's okay that I submit this now. 

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
