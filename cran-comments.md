R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install on R 3.1.2 and R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win builder.

The maintainer has changed from Edmund Hart (also known as Ted) to me (Scott Chamberlain). Edmund emailed Brian Ripley on 2014-11-11 stating that he agreed to this change. Please let me know if you want another email from him. CRAN policies state that "When a new maintainer wishes to take over a package, this should be accompanied by the written agreement of the previous maintainer (unless the package has been formally orphaned)." His email from 2014-11-11 was:

Hi Brian,

I'd like to say it's ok to change maintainers on the rnoaa package to Scott Chamberlain.

Best,
Ted

A note about many submissions from me. Brian Ripley requests that I decrease my submission frequency. The past few package updates have been in response to requests from CRAN maintainers to update packages, so I hope it's okay that I submit this now.

I have read and agree to the the CRAN policies at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
