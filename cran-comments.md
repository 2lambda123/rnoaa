R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install on R 3.2.3 and R development
version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win builder.

This submission adds a number of new data sources, moves rgdal to Suggests,
and fixes a problem where ncdf4 was not found on some Windows environments. 

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
