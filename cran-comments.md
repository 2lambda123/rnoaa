R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install on R 3.2.2 and R development
version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win builder.

This submission adds a number of new NOAA data sources, fixes some 
bugs, adds some minor features (including fixes for the new version
of ggplot2), includes some code tidying and better test suite. 

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
